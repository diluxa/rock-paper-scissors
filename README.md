Project
----------

This is a project where I put the front-end tripod together, html, css and javascript. The goal is to create something that involves everything Iâ€™ve learned in the past few months. The purpose wasn't to write a perfect javascript logic, I just tried to build a project that would allow me to create more intimacy with the language.
